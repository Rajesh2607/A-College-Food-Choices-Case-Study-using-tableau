Title: Problem–Solution Fit – College Food Choices Case Study

Problem:
Many college students face poor dietary habits due to limited awareness, unhealthy food choices, and lack of real-time nutritional feedback. This leads to fatigue, health risks, and lowered academic performance.

Solution:
By using Tableau to analyze food consumption data, we can identify patterns, highlight nutritional gaps, and deliver interactive visualizations that guide healthier food decisions. Our project bridges the gap between raw dietary data and meaningful student wellness insights.

Fit:
✔️ Real-time dashboards align directly with students’ need for awareness  
✔️ Institutions gain insights for targeted interventions  
✔️ Easy-to-understand visual feedback motivates behavior change
