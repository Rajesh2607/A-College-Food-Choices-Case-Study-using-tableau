Title: Problem Statement â€“ College Food Choices Case Study

Problem:
In many educational institutions, students face challenges in maintaining balanced and nutritious diets due to lack of awareness, limited food choices, and absence of real-time insights into their dietary patterns. This often leads to poor health outcomes, reduced academic performance, and long-term wellness concerns.

Proposed Solution:
This project, "Comprehensive Analysis and Dietary Strategies with Tableau," aims to transform raw dietary data into meaningful, real-time visual insights that empower students and university stakeholders to identify dietary trends, spot deficiencies, and implement health-oriented strategies.

By building dynamic Tableau dashboards, institutions will be able to:
- Monitor nutritional intake trends
- Detect widespread deficiencies
- Personalize nutrition plans using predictive analytics

With a data-driven approach, this project promotes healthy eating habits, improves wellness support systems, and strengthens academic success through smarter dietary decisions.
