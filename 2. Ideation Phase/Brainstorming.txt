Title: Brainstorming â€“ College Food Choices Case Study

Objective:
To ideate and explore potential areas of impact, use cases, and opportunities for data-driven insights using Tableau to improve college students' dietary habits.

Brainstormed Ideas:
1. Analyze meal preferences and consumption trends over time.
2. Identify gaps in nutrition such as low intake of fruits, vegetables, or vitamins.
3. Create dashboards to visualize student health indicators alongside dietary patterns.
4. Use data to propose changes in cafeteria menus or nutrition programs.
5. Develop predictive models for identifying students at risk of nutritional deficiencies.
6. Enable real-time alerts for diet anomalies (e.g., reduced protein or fiber intake).
7. Segment data by demographic groups (age, gender, program) to provide tailored dietary strategies.
8. Use clustering to group students by food choices and health profiles.
9. Conduct correlation analysis between food intake and academic performance.

Outcome:
Decided to focus the Tableau project on real-time dietary insights, nutrition deficiency detection, and predictive nutrition planning to drive actionable strategies in colleges.
